## Description

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

  > If you're playing as HUMANPLAYER, you can save the game or forfeit it every time you are asked for input
  >> Test it by writing `save savefile.c4`, `forfeit`, `end`, or `exit`

  ```bash
  python3 ./src/play.py HUMANPLAYER vs HUMANPLAYER
  ```

2. Try to load a saved game

  ```bash
  python3 ./src/play.py load savefile.c4
  ```

3. Try two players on the same network(or pc)

  > The instance with firstplayer=NETWORKPLAYER must be opened first.
  >> [peterrateb/Intelligent-connect-4](https://github.com/peterrateb/Intelligent-connect-4) uses the same networking protocol, so you can even play across clients.

  ```bash
  python3 ./src/play.py NETWORKPLAYER vs HUMANPLAYER --local-port=3501 --peer-address=127.0.0.1 --peer-port=3500
  ```
  ```bash
  python3 ./src/play.py HUMANPLAYER vs NETWORKPLAYER --local-port=3500 --peer-address=127.0.0.1 --peer-port=3501
  ```

4. Try to beat the hard AI

  ```bash
  python3 ./src/play.py HUMANPLAYER vs MINMAXPLAYER --p2-difficulty=HARD
  ```
<br>
